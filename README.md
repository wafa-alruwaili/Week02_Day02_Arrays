Create a file named practice.js to save your solutions.

1- 	Change all odd numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:

		const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

  		// your code here

		numbers; // => [4, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]

2- 	Change all even numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:

		const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

		  // your code here

		numbers; // => [8, 9, 7, 4, 1, 16]

3- 	Create an array to hold your favorite colors. For each choice, log to the screen a string like: My #1 choice is blue.. The rank number must correspond to the array structure.


4-	Using push and unshift, make this array contain the numbers from zero through seven:

		const arr = [2, 3, 4];

		// your code here

		arr; // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

5-	Write a program that has 2 variables, an array of numbers and a key number, and then print true if the key number exists in the array, and zero otherwise.

6-	Write a program that has 2 variables, an array of numbers and a key number, then print all the pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to the key number.
